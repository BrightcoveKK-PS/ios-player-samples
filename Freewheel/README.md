#Basic Freewheel Player

The Freewheel SDK is not included in this pod. You must manually add the Freewheel SDK - *AdManager.framework* - to your project. The pod will however add all the libraries required by AdManager.framework.

To add the AdManager framework to your project:
 
  1. Drag the AdManager.framework file from the Finder into the Frameworks group of the BasicFreewheelPlayer Project of the Xcode workspace.
  1. Add the folder where the AdManager.framework is located to the "framework search paths" Build Settings field.
